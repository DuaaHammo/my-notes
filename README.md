  **The fundamentals of a good developer**

We often hear phrases that weaken the enthusiasm between programmers and website developers, but did we think that in any case, only the first step is always difficult, after which everything becomes smooth and easy to use, so in order to avoid making mistakes, the developerâ€™s mentality must be developed. There are some basic laws that must be To follow it to avoid difficulties, including:
* What is the goal or purpose of this program Make sure that the main goal is to help people.

* One of the most important foundations of design and development is simplicity and clarity, and these two things work to extend the life of the program and avoid modifications later.
It is also important to set priorities to make it easier for the user to make decisions and solve problems to plan for what comes next. For example, tasks must be divided and priorities set from smallest to largest.
So what should you do instead?

* Start small, improve it, and then stretch it.
Plan, then implement, then improve, then do feedback
This enables us to predict errors before they happen, so you don't reinvent the wheel.
As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be "no".
Don't waste your time on repetitive tasks. Set it up and forget it.
